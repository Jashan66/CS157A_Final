CS157A Project

To run the web application, use an IDE that supports Java and works with Apache Tomcat. In IDE, right click on project
and run as server. Only select Tomcat 9.0 as the server since the app might not run on the other versions. 
If successful, opens the home page in web browser. Any issues with the app or server just clean and rebuild the project. Clean and restart the server as well. A backup is provided for the database in a self-contained file labeled "school_dump". Simply import the data with MYSQL
workbench.
